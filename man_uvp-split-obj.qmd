title: Splitting an ecopart_obj
---

At times it might be worthwhile to split an `ecopart_obj` into multiple. For example, you might want to split casts based on the time of day, station, seasons, etc.\n
`split_ecopart_obj()` will return a list with each item being an `ecopart_obj` based on the split.
Users must provide an `ecopart_obj` and a *split_by* argument.\n\n
For example:\n

```{r}
library(EcotaxaTools)
split_objs <- ecopart_example |>
    split_ecopart_obj(split_by = 'stationid')
# this will produce 3 ecopart_objs
names(split_objs)
```
