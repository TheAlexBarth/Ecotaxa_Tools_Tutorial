title: Exporting Ecopart Data
---

You can always export ecopart data directly from Ecotaxa. This is how you would do it for zooscan, planktoscope, etc. However, the UVP requires access to the particle datafiles as well to calculate volume sampled in 1m bins. Exporting through ecopart will export all the files from a given project in one convenient directory.

## Accessing data on Ecopart:

1.  Go to the [ecopart website](https://ecopart.obs-vlfr.fr/).

2.  Select your project or set filters to a desired range of casts

3.  Once projects are selected, select "export selection.

4.  Then Select "RAW"

5.  This will put all the files in a .zip

6.  Extract those files and put them in a directory that you have access to.
