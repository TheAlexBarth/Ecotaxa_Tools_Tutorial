Follow those instructions [here]('./export_UVP_ecopart-export.html).\n\nThe next step is to import your into R for analysis.\n\nAll data in this UVP tutorial comes from the bats validation cruise in the Ecopart project \"UofSC_UVP5_BATS_ae2016\". These casts were along a bats validation along a latitudinal transect.\n\n<img src=\"./media/UVP_Ecopart-Import_Image01_BV-loc.png\"/>\n\nThe exported files should all be in a single directory\n\n<img src=\"./media/UVP_Ecopart-Import_Image02_BV-files.png\"/>\n\n\n1.  Using the r function `ecopart_import()` assign the one argument of a path to the directory of your files\n\n2.  Assign the files to a list object\n\n```{r results='hide', message=FALSE}\npath <- \"~/UVP/EX_BV_Data\" #path to ecopart export directory\necopart_list <- ecopart_import(path) #load files\n```\n\n3.  This will create a three element list which can be used in analysis built into EcotaxaTools\n    1.  \"par_files\" - a list of tibbles with each particle file\n\n    2.  \"zoo_files\" - a list of tibbles with each plankton image file (classic tsv)\n\n    3.  \"meta\" - a tibble with the meta\n\n### Understanding the ecopart file list\n\nIf you are new to working with lists, it's worth [reading](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/names-values.html#list-references) a bit about them. While lists can be clunky, it allows for looping over large amounts of data stored in memory.\n\nBelow, I'll briefly show how to interact with some of the data stored in the ecopart list\n\n#### Looking at zooplankton data\n\nZooplankton data are stored in tibbles in the list \"zoo_files\". You can access elements of a list using the '\\$' operator or by indexing the 'bare' elements with `[[` index operator\n\n```{r}\n\n#all below with index the names files\n\nnames(ecopart_list$zoo_files)\nnames(ecopart_list[[\"zoo_files\"]])\nnames(ecopart_list[[3]])\n\n```\n\nEach zooplankton tibble has data from all vignettes collected from an individual uvp cast. You can access these in multiple ways with either the `$` operator or `[[` operators. These are very similar to the export data from standard Ecotaxa .tsv files. You can read more about those \\[here\\](./main_tsv-file-info.html). The key difference from these files are that some header files are slightly different. Namely, there are no `object_` columns. To account for this, much of the other importing functions for other instruments format to match the UVP.\n\n```{r}\necopart_list$zoo_files[[3]]\n```\n\n#### Looking at particle data\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"self-contained-math":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"output-file":"import_UVP_ecopart_import.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"editor":"visual","theme":"sandstone","title":"Importing UVP Data From Ecopart Export"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
