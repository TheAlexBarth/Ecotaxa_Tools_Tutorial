title: all_taxa()
---

Sometimes it is useful to quickly look at what the different types of taxa are in a project. `all_taxa()` makes this a quick operation to pull out all the taxa from an `ecopart_obj` without looping or massive indexing. This function is really a special use case of [`get_all()`](./query_get-all.html)

Likely, when using this function, it should be combined with `unique()`.

```{r}
library(EcotaxaTools)
ecopart_example |>
    all_taxa() |>
    unique()
```
