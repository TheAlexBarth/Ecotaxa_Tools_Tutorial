EcotaxaTools is an R package I developed to easily manage and analyze output from the [ecotaxa website](https://ecotaxa.obs-vlfr.fr/). Check out the github page for EcotaxaTools [here](https://github.com/TheAlexBarth/EcotaxaTools).

The project is under current development so check back frequently.
You can read the updates tab for new information [here](./info_updates-page.html).

The current build (ver 1.2.0.9000) is primarily for UVP and ecopart data processing. However, there is some functionality which will be useful with the zoo_scan or other standard ecotaxa .tsv files.
