title: Merging casts
---

It might useful to pool or merge casts. This is frequently done if there are multiple casts done in one station, or at a similar time. By pooling casts, it can increase the volume sampled, allowing for more robust estimates of zooplankton abundance. However, be cautious when choosing to merge casts, [averaging casts](uvp_avg-concentration.qmd) will produce similar esitimates and allow for more context about variation at a single site. Read more [here](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2022.898057/full).\n\n

To merge casts, you must provide a *name_map* argument. This should be a list where each element of the list is a character vector with the casts to be merged. The names of the list items will be the new names of the casts. Note that this will merge both `$zoo_files` and `$par_files`.

For Example:
```{r}
library(EcotaxaTools)

#merging casts based on station:
name_map = list(
    'gf' = ecopart_example$meta$profileid[which(ecopart_example$meta$stationid == 'gf')],
    'other' = ecopart_example$meta$profileid[which(ecopart_example$meta$stationid != 'gf')]
)

merged_obj <- ecopart_example |>
    merge_casts(name_map = name_map)
# now there's only two aggregate casts:
names(merged_obj$par_files)
names(merged_obj$zoo_files)
```
